Contribution to Health Technology:
    The idea aims to significantly contribute to public health by enabling early diabetes detection. However, it could emphasize the practical applications of the system more explicitly. For example:
        Will the system be implemented as a mobile app or a web platform?
        How will users interact with the system, and will it provide an option to share results with healthcare professionals?

Uniqueness of the Idea:
    The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset is a commonly used dataset. To stand out, the project should highlight a novel approach or methodology. Suggestions:
        Incorporate additional datasets or collect new data to ensure diversity and generalization.
        Explore features that can personalize the predictions, such as lifestyle factors or region-specific health indicators.
        Consider real-time monitoring or integration with wearable health devices.

Proposal is clear and well-structured. Thank you so much :)
